# Chuck Norris Joke Telegram Bot

## Python Version

This project is built using Python version 3.11.

## Project Description

This project is a Telegram bot designed to entertain users with Chuck Norris jokes. The bot provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a language and a joke number between 1 and 25. It then fetches and delivers a Chuck Norris joke in the chosen language.

## Features

- Users can choose a language (e.g., English, Spanish, etc.).
- Users can select a joke number from 1 to 25.
- The bot scrapes Chuck Norris jokes from a dedicated source.
- It extracts and sends the joke corresponding to the user's language and chosen number.

## Configuration

The bot requires an encryption key and a bot token for secure communication. These sensitive credentials are stored in separate files: `bottoken.txt` and `encryptionkey.txt`. For security reasons, these files are not included in the public GitHub repository.

## Deployment

The bot is deployed and already running on the AWS cloud, ensuring it is accessible to users around the clock.

## Requirements

The project's Python dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.
